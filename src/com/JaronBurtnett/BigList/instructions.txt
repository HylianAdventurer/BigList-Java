CSC 410 – Assignment – Big Number List 1

Consider this a prototype for a future project. As such you can make some judgement calls
about how you solve the problems.   Our answers may not be identical in this round of development.

To demonstrate the task, here is sample output as well as a description of the values.

M:  17 17  1 14  1 12  5  7 12 23
N:  21  7 37 16 26 27 22 27 32 33
P:   4 10 36  2 25 15 17 20 20 10
Q:   4  2 36  2 25  3  2  3  4 11
R:   4  2 35  2 24  3  4  2  4  2

M: a list of numbers 1 to High1
N: a list of numbers 1 to High2
The next 3 are pairwise based on index k of the list
P: the difference between the element in Mk and Nk
Q: the largest value ( < max(Mk,Nk) ) that divides Mk & Nk with a remainder of 0 or 1
R: the largest value ( < max(Mk,Pk) ) that divides Mk & Pk with a remainder of 0 or 1
Make these parameters easy to change – but you can edit your code to make it happen.
    Number of items in the list
    Source of values in the M & N lists
    Threshold of Q & R  ( for instance remainder is 2 or less, etc. )
    The number of items to print

For now, fill your list with random values.  In the future for testing we may have a more specific filling procedure.
Time your code.  Consider timing sections rather than the full program so you can reason about speed-up, efficiency, etc.
